Here’s a detailed tutorial that demonstrates various operations on a MySQL table, including inserting, merging, updating, and more.

### 1. Creating a Database
First, create a database to work on.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
USE my_database;
```
### 2. Creating a Table
We’ll create a products table to work on with fields id, name, price, and created_at.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
### 3. Inserting Data
You can insert data into the products table using the following SQL query:

Insert Single Record
```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price) 
VALUES ('Laptop', 999.99);
```
 Insert Multiple Records
```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price) 
VALUES 
    ('Phone', 499.99),
    ('Tablet', 299.99),
    ('Monitor', 199.99);
```
### 4. Selecting Data
To retrieve data, use SELECT queries.

Select All Rows
```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
Select Specific Columns
```
```sql
SELECT name, price FROM products;
```
### 5. Updating Data
To modify an existing record, use the UPDATE query.

```sql
UPDATE products 
SET price = 899.99
WHERE name = 'Laptop';
```
### 6. Deleting Data
To remove data from a table, use the DELETE statement.

Delete a Specific Record
```sql
DELETE FROM products 
WHERE name = 'Monitor';
Delete All Rows from a Table
```sql
DELETE FROM products;
```
### 7. Merging (UPSERT)
In MySQL, MERGE or UPSERT is commonly done using INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE. This is useful when you want to insert a row, but update it if it already exists.

Let's first add a unique index on the name column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD UNIQUE(name);
Now, you can use INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE:
```
```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price) 
VALUES ('Laptop', 1099.99)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE price = VALUES(price);
```
This will insert a new row if the name doesn’t exist, or update the price if it does.

### 8. Merge Using REPLACE
REPLACE works similarly to INSERT, but if the row exists (based on the primary key or unique key), it first deletes the existing row and then inserts the new row.

```sql
REPLACE INTO products (id, name, price) 
VALUES (1, 'Laptop', 1099.99);
```
This will either insert a new row if id=1 doesn’t exist, or replace the existing one.

### 9. Select with Filtering (WHERE)
Filter by Price
To get products with a price less than $500:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE price < 500;
```
### 10. Ordering Data
To order the result by price, use the ORDER BY clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products 
ORDER BY price ASC;  -- Use DESC for descending order
```
### 11. Limit the Number of Results
To limit the number of rows returned:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 2;
```
### 12. Using Aggregates (COUNT, AVG, SUM)
Count Total Products
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_products FROM products;
```
Get the Average Price of All Products
```sql
SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price FROM products;
```
Calculate Total Value of All Products
```sql
SELECT SUM(price) AS total_value FROM products;
```
### 13. Joining Tables
Let’s create another table categories and demonstrate how joins work.

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO categories (category_name) 
VALUES ('Electronics'), ('Home Appliances');
```
Now, let’s add a category_id field to products and demonstrate a join.

```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN category_id INT;

UPDATE products SET category_id = 1 WHERE name IN ('Laptop', 'Phone', 'Tablet');
```
Inner Join Example
```sql
SELECT products.name, products.price, categories.category_name 
FROM products 
JOIN categories ON products.category_id = categories.id;
```
### 14. Altering a Table
Add a New Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN stock INT DEFAULT 100;
```
Modify a Column's Type
```sql

ALTER TABLE products MODIFY COLUMN stock INT DEFAULT 0;
```
Remove a Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN stock;
```
### 15. Transactions
Transactions help in maintaining data consistency. You can group multiple queries and either commit them or roll them back if something goes wrong.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE products SET price = 1200.00 WHERE name = 'Laptop';
DELETE FROM products WHERE name = 'Tablet';

COMMIT;  -- Or use ROLLBACK if you want to undo the changes
```
### 16. Indexes
Create an Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_price ON products(price);
```
Drop an Index

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_price ON products;
```
### 17. Dropping Tables or Databases
Drop a Table
```sql
DROP TABLE products;
Drop a Database
```
```sql
DROP DATABASE my_database;
```
Summary
This tutorial covered a wide range of MySQL operations like creating, inserting, updating, deleting, merging, selecting, and altering tables. By using this guide, you can manage your MySQL databases effectively.
