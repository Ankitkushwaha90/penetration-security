# CSS Grid System

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex and responsive layouts with ease. Unlike Flexbox, which is mostly one-dimensional (either row or column), Grid allows you to work both horizontally and vertically.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build layouts using CSS Grid by defining rows, columns, and grid items.

## Understanding the Grid

A CSS Grid consists of rows and columns that you define, turning your container into a grid layout. You can place items into this grid and control their size and position.

### Example of a Grid:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 200px);
  gap: 10px;
}
```
<Note> `grid-template-columns` defines the number of columns, while `grid-template-rows` defines the number of rows. The `1fr` unit means a flexible fraction of the available space. </Note> <CodeBlock> ```html <div class="container"> <div>Item 1</div> <div>Item 2</div> <div>Item 3</div> <div>Item 4</div> <div>Item 5</div> <div>Item 6</div> </div> ``` </CodeBlock>
This example creates a 3x2 grid with each row being 200px tall and a 10px gap between items.

### Defining Columns and Rows
You can control the size and number of columns and rows using the following properties:

- **grid-template-columns**: Defines the number and size of columns.
- **grid-template-rows**: Defines the number and size of rows.
### Example:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 300px;
}
```
This example creates a grid with 3 columns: the first is 100px, the second is 200px, and the third takes up the remaining space (1fr). There are also 2 rows with specified heights.

### Grid Item Placement
You can explicitly place grid items in specific rows and columns using the following properties:

- **grid-column-start**: Specifies where a grid item starts.
- **grid-column-end**: Specifies where a grid item ends.
- **grid-row-start**: Specifies where a grid item starts.
- **grid-row-end**: Specifies where a grid item ends.
### Example:
```css
.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Span two columns */
  grid-row: 1 / 2; /* Span one row */
}
```
<CodeBlock> ```html <div class="container"> <div class="item1">Item 1</div> <div>Item 2</div> <div>Item 3</div> <div>Item 4</div> <div>Item 5</div> <div>Item 6</div> </div> ``` </CodeBlock>
This places item1 across the first and second columns, spanning one row.

### Grid Lines
CSS Grid works with grid lines, which are the lines between rows and columns. You can reference these lines by their numbers to place items more precisely.

### Example:
```css
.item2 {
  grid-column: 2 / 4; /* Start at line 2, end at line 4 */
  grid-row: 1 / 3; /* Start at line 1, end at line 3 */
}
```
<Note> Grid lines are numbered, starting from 1. Negative numbers count from the end of the grid. </Note>
### Grid Areas
You can define larger grid areas for layout purposes by naming them and using the grid-area property.

Example:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header header"
    "sidebar main main"
    "footer footer footer";
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}
.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.main {
  grid-area: main;
}
.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
```
<CodeBlock> ```html <div class="container"> <div class="header">Header</div> <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div> <div class="main">Main Content</div> <div class="footer">Footer</div> </div> ``` </CodeBlock>
This creates a layout with a header at the top, a sidebar on the left, main content in the center, and a footer at the bottom.

### Responsive Grid Design
You can make grids responsive using media queries and the auto-fit or auto-fill features in grid layouts.

Example of a Responsive Grid:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```
This grid automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the available space. Each column will be at least 200px wide, but will expand to fill the remaining space.

### Conclusion
CSS Grid is a powerful tool that gives you control over both the horizontal and vertical layout of elements. With it, you can create flexible, responsive, and complex layouts with ease. By combining grid areas, row/column control, and responsive techniques, you can build advanced and adaptable designs for your websites.
