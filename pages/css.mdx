# CSS Basics

In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of CSS and how to apply styles to your HTML elements. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define the look and feel of a website, from fonts and colors to layouts and animations.

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It controls how HTML elements are displayed. It helps separate the content (HTML) from the visual presentation of the content (CSS).

<Note>
CSS enables you to style elements globally or locally. Global styles apply to all elements, while local styles only apply to specific elements.
</Note>

## Adding CSS to HTML

There are three ways to add CSS to your HTML document:

1. **Inline CSS**: Add CSS directly to the HTML element.
2. **Internal CSS**: Add CSS inside the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` of your HTML document.
3. **External CSS**: Link an external CSS file to your HTML document.

### Example of Inline CSS:

```html
<p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
```
### Example of Internal CSS:
```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>This paragraph will be blue.</p>
</body>
```
### Example of External CSS:
```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>This paragraph will follow the styles defined in the external CSS file.</p>
</body>
```
### CSS Selectors
Selectors are used to target HTML elements to apply styles. The most common types of selectors are:

- **Element Selector**: Targets all elements of a specific type.
- **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
- **ID Selector**: Targets a specific element with an ID.
### Example:
```css
/* Element Selector */
p {
  color: green;
}

/* Class Selector */
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

/* ID Selector */
#unique-heading {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```
<CodeBlock> ```html <h1 id="unique-heading">Hello, World!</h1> <p class="blue-text">This is a blue paragraph.</p> ``` </CodeBlock>
CSS Properties
CSS consists of property-value pairs that define specific style rules. Here are some common properties:

**Color** : Sets the text color of an element.
**Font-size**: Sets the size of the text.
**Background-color**: Sets the background color of an element.
**Margin**: Controls the space outside of an element.
**Padding**: Controls the space inside an element's border.
### Example:
```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-size: 16px;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
### CSS Box Model
Every HTML element is treated as a box, which consists of:

Content: The actual content of the element.
Padding: Space between the content and the border.
Border: The line surrounding the padding (optional).
Margin: Space outside the border.
<Note> Understanding the CSS box model is crucial for controlling the layout and spacing of elements. </Note>
Example:
css
Copy code
div {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
}
<CodeBlock> ```html <div>This is a box model example.</div> ``` </CodeBlock>
Responsive Design with CSS
Responsive design ensures that your website looks good on all devices. CSS helps with this through:

Media Queries: Apply different styles based on screen size.
Flexbox: A layout model that allows elements to be arranged dynamically within a container.
Grid: A two-dimensional layout system for complex designs.
Media Query Example:
css
Copy code
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
<Note> Media queries help make your design responsive by adapting the layout to different screen sizes. </Note>
Conclusion
CSS is a powerful tool for creating visually appealing web pages. By mastering the basics, you can enhance the look and functionality of your website.

Make sure to experiment with different properties and selectors as you continue to explore CSS.

<Note> Keep learning! CSS is the foundation of web design, and there's always more to discover. </Note> ```
Key Components:
Title & Meta: The title and description fields in the frontmatter define the page's metadata.
Importing Components: Components like Note and CodeBlock can be imported to display special notes or code examples.
Markdown + JSX: The content is written in a mix of Markdown and JSX, which can include React components.
